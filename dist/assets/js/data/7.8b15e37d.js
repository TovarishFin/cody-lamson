I wrote 90% of the code for the entire ecosystem of smart contracts. The ecosystem is not small or simple either. Despite the large amount of functionality and complexity, audits by both SmartDec and Consensys found no major or medium bugs. What this means is that there were no bugs which actually threated intended functionality. There were only minor suggestions for optimizations. Links to audits can be found <a href="https://github.com/brickblock-io/smart-contracts/tree/master/docs/audits" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id="cool-things-that-were-developed-by-me-at-brickblock"><a href="#cool-things-that-were-developed-by-me-at-brickblock" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Cool Things that were Developed by Me at Brickblock</h2>\n<p>I think one of the neater things that I came up with there was a way of getting around gas limits for a single address smart contract. This can be accomplished by chaining <code>delegatecall</code> proxy contracts. I also came up with and desgined what is now called I believe unstructured storage. Where storage slots are determined based on <code>keccak256 bytes32</code> storage slots.</p>\n<h2 id="mainnet-deployed--exchange-listed"><a href="#mainnet-deployed--exchange-listed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mainnet Deployed &#x26; Exchange Listed</h2>\n<p>The full set of contracts have been deployed on mainnet. The BBK token can be found on several exchanges and can be found on marketcap listing sites such as <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/brickblock/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">coinmarketcap.com</a> and <a href="https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/Brickblock-_BBK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">livecoinwatch.com</a>.
