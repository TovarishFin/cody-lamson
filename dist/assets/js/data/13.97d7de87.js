The token was written so that the <code>totalSupply</code> always returned 100 tokens. With that in mind I thought it would be a neat idea to use that concept for good instead. The idea is simple... a token where you have 100 tokens to start but can also use them as a regular token. This is really nice for quick tests on testnets where you need a token but don\'t care <strong>which</strong> token it is. It is also nice for people who are just getting started with ERC20 tokens and dont want to risk real tokens.</p>\n',image:{type:"image",mimeType:"image/png",src:"/images/projects/noob-coin-smart-contract.png"},liveLink:"https://github.com/TovarishFin/NoobCoin",features:[{name:"Everyone gets 100 NCN (NoobCoin)",description:""},{name:"ERC20 Compliance",description:"All interfaces required for ERC20 compliance is still met."},{name:"Deployed to many testnets",description:"Deployed to many testnets, allowing flexible usage."},{name:"Plug and Play",description:"Just add the address for the appropriate network listed in the GitHub readme and you are good to go.
