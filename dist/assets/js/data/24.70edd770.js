However I was allowed to share this part of my work. It works by creating a unique hash with <code>msg.data</code> and nonce.\nDifferent voters can then run the function in order to vote on running that same function. This has the benefit of making the contract a bit more transparent than a traditional multi-sig contract.\nIt also limits the functionality which can be seen as both a good thing and a bad thing.</p>\n',image:{type:"image",mimeType:"image/png",src:"/images/projects/voteable-owner.png"},liveLink:"https://github.com/TovarishFin/votable-owner",features:[{name:"Clear Voting Mechanics",description:"Other MultiSig wallets take the destination and bytes calldata as arguments, this does not require this."},{name:"Clear Limitations of Functionality",description:"With clear limitations on what the contract can do, more security can be achieved"},{name:"Easily Extended",description:"Additional voteable actions can be added in a very easy way"},{name:"Well Documented",description:"Uses natspec for clear documentation on smart contract functionality"}],languages:[{name:"Solidity",description:"Contracts are written in solidity"},{name:"Javascript",description:"Tests are written in Javascript using truffle"}]}}}}}]);
