        <p class="title secondary--text">Full Stack Work</p>
        <p>
          Can build out the backend, database, and client that you need. Can
          also do deployments using Kubernetes or Heroku. Comfortable building
          the backend, database, and frontend. I am most comfortable doing this
          with Node, Express, MongoDB. I am experienced with Polymer, Angular,
          and React. If you have another framework or language that you wish to
          use I am open to discussion.

        <p class="title secondary--text">Frontend Work</p>
        <p>
          Can build a modern web application using modern frameworks such as
          React. Comfortable building frontends with a variety of frameworks. I
          am most comfortable doing this with Polymer, React or Angular. From my
          experience I believe that if you have a different framework in mind,
          this should not be a huge problem. I keep up with most developments
          regarding frontend frameworks.
