## My First Personal Project Decentralized Application
While talking with my wife one night, we came up with this idea. She took care of the designs and I took care of the smart contracts, and DApp.

## Great Practice
I built this during while I was working at Brickblock. A lot of the patterns that I decided to use, I eventually implemented in the Brickblock platform. 

## Mainnet Launch?
I might one day release this on mainnet... the DApp just never seems to be done and I always have some other new thing that I want to focus on :)
