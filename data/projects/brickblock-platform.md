## My Starting Work at Brickblock
When I first started at Brickblock, my main work was with various React based web apps.

## Hooking Smart Contracts up to a Web Client
Within a few months, I was spending most of my time working on the smart contracts. However I would say that I still spent around 30% of my time on the platform. I spent a lot of time later on connecting the client to the new smart contracts as well as writing/rewriting/testing the different sagas which were used for connecting and managing blockchain state.
