## My First Frontend Framework
I started playing with angular when it first came out as one of the firest frontend frameworks. It was amazing at the time and a lot of fun to use. I started learning AngularJS shortly after learning node.

## Experience
I used AngularJS for building a retail management portal as well as a variety of e-commerce sites for different companies. However, I never really got into the subsequent updates (Angular, 2 - 5+). I did a few courses to see what was new... but never ended up doing much with it. Instead I moved on to Polymer and then React and then Vue (javascript moves fast!).

I used AngularJS as the frontend of node-based sites as well as PHP sites. Haven't done much with Angular lately.
