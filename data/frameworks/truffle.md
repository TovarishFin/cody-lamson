## Experience
Truffle has many uses, but the main thing I use this for is integration tests in JavaScript and unit tests in Solidity. I have a ton of experience writing tests using truffle. Many of my smart contract projects have 300+ tests. I like to think of it as the best way of getting to know and exploring the smart contract code that you write. Testing is especially important with smart contracts given the immutable nature of them.
