## The new Popular Kid on the Block
Everyone used to rave about React, now they rave about Vue. Vue is the new flavor of the month, but is indeed a great frontend framework and tends to lower development time when comparing to React. I have found it to be a pleasure to work with, though I have not problem with React either.

## Experience
I have built several different web apps using Vue. 2 of them are decentralized applications. One for a client and another personal. This site is also built on Vue.

## React Equivalent Tools for Vue
I have experience working with Vue Router, Vuex, and Vuetify. These would be the equivalents of React Router, Redux and Material-UI in React Land.
