I use OpenZeppelin smart contracts whenever possible. I am more than happy to take advantage of code which has been extensively audited when working with smart contracts. I have plenty of experience extending and overriding various OpenZeppelin smart contracts, including ERC20 and Ownable contracts to name a few.
