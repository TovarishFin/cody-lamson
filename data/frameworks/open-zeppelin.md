## Trustable Smart Contracts
Open Zeppelin smart contracts are known to be the best and most secure smart contracts you can find in the ecosystem. They are open source, audited, and peer reviewed. It is a good idea to use these contracts or extend them wherever possible.

## Experience
I am more than happy to take advantage of code which has been extensively audited when working with smart contracts. I have plenty of experience extending and overriding various OpenZeppelin smart contracts, including ERC20 and Ownable contracts to name a few. I think I have used or interacted with around 70% of all of the contracts offered by Open Zeppelin. This includes things such as:
- `Roles.sol`
- `Crowdsale.sol`
- `ECDSA.sol`
- `MerkleProof.sol`
- `TokenVesting.sol`
- `SafeMath.sol`
- `Ownable.sol`
- `Pausable.sol`
- `ERC20.sol`
- `ERC721.sol`

I have started to use the latest version which uses solidiy version 0.5.x .
