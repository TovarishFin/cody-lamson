## Experience
I have worked on smart contracts for more than five different projects in the last several years. I have experience with many different forms of functionality when it comes to smart contracts. 

## A Track Record you can Trust
I have had more than 10 smart contracts audited by authoritative auditors. None of the audits have shown any major or medium bugs (anything that would affect code execution) for any code I have written so far. I am aware and like to keep up with major vulnerabilities and treat hacking smart contracts as some sort of secondary hobby. You can see me on a leaderboard for smart contract hackend at [capturetheether.com](https://capturetheether.com/leaderboard/), I am TovarishFin.

## High Code Quality
As stated above, I write code that is aware of any current vulnerabilities. I also take testing **very** seriously. Many of my projects, both personal and professional, have well over 300 tests. I also make use of linters for code consistency and quality.

## Getting Under the Hood
I am no stranger to using solidity inline assembly when the high level language offerings are too limited or inefficient. 

## Knowledge of Very Useful Patterns
I am able to write very flexible smart contracts which can be upgraded in a variety of ways. I also know how to integrate services such as Oraclize or Kleros.
