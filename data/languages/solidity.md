Have built 90% of the upcoming Brickblock smart contract ecosystem. Have also built a variety of other open source smart contracts, some of them using Oraclize. Have had several auditing companies audit my code, none of them have shown severe or even medium issues. This is my passion. I work on smart contracts both professionally and for fun.
