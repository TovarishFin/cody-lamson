## Experience
I used C# work on a legacy backend for Adidas. I also created a few basic games using unity with C#. For the most part I have only used this language for the single 6 month project.

## Proficiency
I would say that my knowledge is quite basic when it comes to this language. I only learnt enough to modify the backend to do what was needed.
