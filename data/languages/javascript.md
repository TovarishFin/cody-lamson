## Experience
Javascript has become a very versatile language which can be used for many different things. I have quite a wide range of experience to match. 
I have worked with/built servers, clients, tools, and testing suites. Javascript has become the defacto supplemental language for ethereum related things with libraries/frameworks like truffle and web3. 
This has helped me become an even more effective smart contract developer in the ethereum ecosystem.

## Javascript in Relation to Ethereum
As already stated, I have quite a bit of experience with truffle and web3. This means that not only do I write well tested & high quality smart contracts, but also can connect them to a client using web3/metamask. 
My knowledge of React and Vue means that I can indeed build out the full stack of a decentralized application; from smart contracts all the way to the client, I have it covered.

## Keeping up with the Times
Javascript and related libraries tend to get updated VERY quickly. I keep up with a fair deal of this stuff. This can be seen with my knowledge of modern client side frameworks like React and Vue. 
I also am well versed in things like webpack, babel, ES6 and ES7.

## The Right Tools for the Job
I have plenty of experience with different code quality tools such as prettier, eslint. I am familiar with type systems like typescript and flow. I like to think that I write code of very high quality.
