language: PHP
experience: 4 years

Haven't used in a very long time. used to work with API service integrations, templating, and e-commerce. I haven't been keeping up with PHP and to be honest I would prefer to not work on a project that used PHP as the main language. Working with small amounts on legacy code in PHP is fine.
