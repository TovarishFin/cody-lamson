## Experience
This is a language that I really want to get into but haven't had the time to create any significant projects with it. Currently I am using it to create a bitcoin blockchain clone. 

## Aspirations
I want to eventually look into rebuilding geth from scratch. It would be a great learning experience to see how the Ethereum EVM works and get a better grasp on go as well.
